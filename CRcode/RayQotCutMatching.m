% function RayQotCutMatching calculates the eigenvector corresponding to
% the largest eigenvalue in terms of Rayleigh quotient
% Input:
%     Weight: weight matrix encoding the edge weights
%     X: matching within the graph
%     lambda_1, lambda_2: refer to paper
%     Type: 1. Rayleigh quotient
%           2. normalized cut according to Shi (2002)
%           3. normalized according to Jordan & Weiss (2002)
