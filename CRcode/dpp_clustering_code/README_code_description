This tar file contains the code of the DPP-cluster clustering algorithm and the baseline clustering algorithms described in the paper:


Improved Lexical Acquisition through DPP-based Verb Clustering, Roi Reichart and Anna Korhonen, ACL 2013.
  
In addition we provide the clustering evaluation code we used in our experiments.
The DPP sampling code used here is adjusted from the code in Alex Kulesza's web page.

1. To run the DPP-cluster algorithm, run the following MATLAB functions:

iterative_clustering_by_mapping (k=number_of_clusters, m=number_of_dpp_samples, number_of_iter , nus=number_of_good_samples, local_threshold_bound , iteration2_threshold )

clusters = hierarhical_clusterings_cl (dpp_output_clusters, matrix=kernel_matrix, number_of_clusters=k)

2. To run the AC algorithm (agglomerative clustering where DPP is replaced with a uniform sampling):

replace the iterative_clustering_by_mapping with:

random_iterative_clustering_by_mapping_updated (matrix,k,m,number_of_iter,nus, local_threshold_bound,iteration2_threshold)

3. To run the spectral clustering baseline:

spectral_clustering_meila (matrix,k,init_flag, center_indexes,gold)

Where:

 matrix and k are as before

 init_flag is set to 1 if initializing cluster centers are  provided and center_indexes are the centers themselves. The code is quite self exploratory.

4. The functions whose name is in the form of calculate*.m provide various verb clustering evaluation methods.
